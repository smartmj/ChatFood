# ChatFood: A LLM-powered Agentic Food Ordering Assistant

## 📌 Overview
ChatFood is an intelligent chatbot designed as part of an NLP course project using the **LangGraph** framework. It acts as a virtual assistant in a hypothetical food ordering application, offering users various services, including:

- 📖 **Providing general and specialized food-related information**
- 🍽️ **Recommending dishes based on user preferences**
- 🔍 **Searching for available foods in restaurants**
- 📦 **Tracking and canceling orders**
- 🛠️ **Managing user interactions through an intuitive UI (Chainlit)**

This project allows students to gain hands-on experience in chatbot development, **multi-agent architectures, RAG-based retrieval, LangGraph workflows, and database management**.

## 🎯 Objectives
This project aims to:
- Introduce **LangGraph** for designing an intelligent chatbot with agent-based reasoning.
- Demonstrate the integration of tools like **Tavily**, **LlamaParse**, **LanceDB**, and **Chainlit**.
- Teach best practices in **chatbot architecture**, **LLM-driven interactions**, and **structured output processing**.
- Encourage students to explore **document-based retrieval (RAG)** and **multi-stage reasoning** using **ReAct** and **Plan-and-Execute** architectures.

## 🚀 Features
### ✅ Foods and Meals QA (Information Retrieval)
- Uses **Hybrid RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** to provide detailed food-related knowledge.
- Retrieves structured information from **a knowledge base (book corpus) or online sources** (via Tavily API).

### ✅ Food Recommendations
- Implements **multi-step reasoning** to suggest relevant dishes based on user preferences.
- Ensures that recommended dishes are available in listed restaurants.

### ✅ Order Management
- Users can **check order status**, **cancel an order**, and **leave a review**.
- The chatbot interacts with a **SQLite-based order database**.

### ✅ Food Search
- Allows users to **search for foods in restaurants** by name or category.
- Uses **natural language search** with **fuzzy matching**.

### ✅ Chainlit UI
- Provides a **web-based chat interface** using **Chainlit**.
- Supports real-time interaction with chatbot responses.

## 🏗️ Architecture
ChatFood is built using **LangGraph**, leveraging its graph-based workflow to create an **efficient and scalable agentic chatbot**. The system consists of:
- **Food Info Agent**: Handles food-related queries (via RAG & Tavily API).
- **Recommendation Agent**: Suggests food items based on user inputs.
- **Order Manager**: Manages orders (checking status, cancellations, and reviews).
- **Food Search Module**: Retrieves food details from the database.

- **Tavily API** (for real-time web search)
- **LlamaParse** (for document parsing)
- **SQLite** (for order management database)
- **Chainlit** (for UI interface)

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup
```sh
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/chatfood.git
cd chatfood

# Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
python -m venv env
